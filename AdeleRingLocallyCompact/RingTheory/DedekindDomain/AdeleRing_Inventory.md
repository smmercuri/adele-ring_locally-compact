# AdeleRing.lean Inventory

This file currently contains results about the adele ring.

The main results of this file involve the definition of the adele ring as the direct product of the infinite adele ring and the finite adele ring, and we endow it with a topological space. 

### Definitions

- `DedekindDomain.adeleRing`: $\mathbb{A}_K := \mathbb{A}_{K, \infty} \times \mathbb{A}_{K, f}$.

### Instances

- `AdeleRing.topologicalSpace`: $\mathbb{A}_{K}$ is given the product topology.
